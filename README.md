# Aimated Portfolio Website

![Portfolio project](/public/images/portfolio.jpg)

This is a fun and dynamic portfolio website that I made with React and Framer Motion! When building this design,
it was a major goal to maintain a minimal aestetic. I wanted to maintain a level of simplicity with lots of open space and very **BOLD** fonts directiing the eye.

## Framer Motion

This project was a great way for me to learn one of my favorite React libraries, Framer Motion! The simplicity of this library helped me feel comfortable with using other libraries and frameworks. I wanted to find an practical way to animate between pages AND a efficient way to create smooth animations inside the pages themselves with minimal, lightweight code. Framer Motion was great these needs.

## Why this is no longer my current portfolio website.

This was a really fun design and the animations implemented really make it pop. However, I wanted something even **more** minimalistic to repesent my personal tastes in design and 'feel'.
